      "HUMAN: Pretending you are a florist. Please design a bouquet for my friend's birthday. My friend is a very sweet and lovely woman. She likes pastel colors. She has bright skin and dark hair. I only have 2 pink lilies, 5 pink roses, 10 peonies in the shades of light pink and white, 5 light orange ranunculus and some yellow purple freesias. Please list down materials and step-by-step instruction to arrange a loose, garden-style bouquet personalized to her based on color theory in floral design.\n",

      "Materials:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 2 pink lilies\n",
      "- 5 pink roses\n",
      "- 10 peonies in light pink and white shades\n",
      "- 5 light orange ranunculus\n",
      "- Some yellow and purple freesias\n",
      "- Floral foam or a vase\n",
      "- Ribbon (optional)\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Start with the tallest flowers as the centerpiece, the pink lilies and some of the tallest peonies. Place them in the floral foam or vase first. This creates the initial height and shape of the bouquet.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Add in more peonies around the centerpiece flowers to create fullness while gradually building outwards. Alternate between the light pink and white peonies for a varied look.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Next, incorporate the pink roses. Disperse them throughout the arrangement, inserting them between the peonies. The roses will add more color and their circular shape provides a nice contrast to the peonies.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Add in the light orange ranunculus as accents, inserting them on the outer edges of the bouquet. Their bright color will stand out against the more pastel-colored flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Finally, add in the yellow and purple freesias to bring in complementary colors and texture. Place them scattererd throughout the bouquet to create a loose, effortless feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Once satisfied with the arrangement, wrap the base of the bouquet with ribbon and trim any excess stems to a uniform length. This completes the loose, garden-style birthday bouquet for your friend utilizing her preferred pastel colors. Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any of the steps.\n"
